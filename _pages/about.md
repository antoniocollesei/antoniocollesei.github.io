I'm a researcher in Bioinformatics and Computational Oncology at the Veneto Instute of Oncology, Italy, and former Ph.D student (2020-2023) at the University of Padova. I have been part of [Vandin Lab](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/people.html) and [AIDA Lab](https://aidalabdei.github.io/) (Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy).
My research mainly focuses on developing methods for omics data to unveil the underlying biology in cancer cohorts. I have also been working on machine learning models in observational and clinical studies.

I received my Master's Degree in Bioengineering from the University of Padova in 2017, including a one-year visiting research period at the Medizinische Universit√§t, Innsbruck, Austria, under the supervision of Zlatko Trajanoski and [Francesca Finotello](https://computationalbiomedicinegroup.github.io/). Between my Master's and Ph.D. I temporarily switched to industry, working for an italian multinational company ([Inventis](http://www.inventis.it/world)).

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing team sports in official tournaments (kind of competitive guy) or even pick-up games in the park. I also produce and star in short movies, occasionally winning prizes. Check out [Hidden Embers on YouTube](`https://www.youtube.com/user/hiddenembers`). Most of it is in italian, but we are *working hard* to make subtitles available.
