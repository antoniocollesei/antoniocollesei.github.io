Antonio Collesei is a doctoral researcher in Computational Biology at the Veneto Instute of Oncology, Padua, Italy. He is currently part of `<a href='https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/PI.html'>` Vandin Lab `</a>` and  `<a href='https://aidalabdei.github.io/'>` AIDA Lab `</a>` at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova, Italy.
His research mainly focuses on developing causal methods for omics data to unveil the underlying biology in cancer patients. He has also been working on machine learning models in observational and clinical studies.

They received their Master's Degree in Bioengineering from the University of Padova in 2017, including a one-year visiting research period at the Medizinische UniversitÃ¤t, Innsbruck, Austria.

Enough with the third-person, I am lucky if you read until here, but that was the official bit.
As my Ph.D. period is going to be concluded by the end of the year, I am exploring visiting opportunities for the next few months.

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing team sports in official tournaments (kind of competitive guy) or even pick-up games in the park. I also produce and star in short movies, occasionally winning prizes. Check out `<a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/hiddenembers'>` Hidden Embers on YouTube `</a>`. Most of it is in italian, but we are *"**working hard"* to make subtitles available.
