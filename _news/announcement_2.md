Today Paola Donolato successfully defended her Master's Thesis in Computer Science.
We had the pleasure to have her at our lab in the last months, and she definitely forged her own space among us. Congrats to her (and her advisor Fabio Vandin)!

We had quite some celebration time at the Park. Here above the pic with the co-advisors.
